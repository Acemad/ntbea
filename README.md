##N-Tuple Bandit Evolutionary Algorithm (NTBEA)

The NTBEA combines multi-armed bandits (actually combinatorial multi-armed bandits) with an evolutionary 
algorithm to provide a sample-efficient optimisation algorithm.  Currently the algorithm works only in discrete search spaces.
Continuous parameters can be handled by discretising them.
